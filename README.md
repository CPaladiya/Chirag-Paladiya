## What Am I Currently Working On?
+ Currently I am enjoying my work at USNR as a software developer. I have been fortunate enough to obtain a position that allows me ample room to learn, implement, experiment and grow. 
+ After joinin USNR in September of 2021, I have extensively worked on in-house developed AI labeling tool and within the core programming R&D team, to develop software enabling our lumber industry customers to identify wood defects with the help of AI and traditional methods of image processing.
+ Meanwhile, I have started a website [QriousBits.com](https://qriousbits.com/), where I explain confusing concepts that is hard to understand for newbie developers and about my journey into the world of programming.
+ Checkout my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiragpaladiya7979/) posts to see videos about various professional projects I have done and posts I have written so far.

## My Mission and Vision In Life

+ :dart::earth_asia: My Mission : 
> Creating engineering solutions, software systems and products that are environmentally optimal, robust, sturdy, inherently intuitive to use and beautiful to look at with larger than life character to it!</br>
+ :dart::checkered_flag: My Vision : 
> I want to leave behind a better and a sentient world than I know as it is today. Through my work and attitude towards life, I want to positively influence people I am surrounded with and those who rely on the products that I help create. I believe in looking at bigger picture, doing good and pouring my heart and soul into my creations!</br>
