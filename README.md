# Chirag Paladiya : My Programming Profile

## Recent Grad : C++ Dev : Udacity : Ready To Join Your Team!

## What Am I Currently Working On?
+ Developing my own Algorithm <code>Multiple Line Of Sights : MLOS</code> that superseeds <code> A-Star Path Search</code> Algorithm. I plan to make GUI project to showcase my algorithm.
+ Preparing for coding interviews to join ambitious and talented team as a ***Junior C++ Developer***, whoes mission and vision aligns with mine.

## My Mission and Vision In Life

+ :dart::earth_asia: My Mission : 
> Creating engineering solutions, software systems and products that are environmently optimal, robust, sturdy, inherently intiutive to use and beautiful to look at with larger than life character to it!</br>
+ :dart::checkered_flag: My Vision : 
> I want to leave behind a better and a sentient world than I know as it is today. Through my work and attitude towards life, I want to positively influence people I am surrounded with and those who rely on the products that I help create. I believe in looking at bigger picture, doing good and pouring my heart and soul into my creations!</br>
