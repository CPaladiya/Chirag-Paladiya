## What Am I Currently Working On?
+ Developing my own Algorithm <code>Line Of Sight : LOS : Path Search Algorithm</code> that supersedes <code> A-Star Path Search Algorithm.</code> I plan to make GUI project to showcase my algorithm.
+ Preparing for coding interviews to join ambitious and talented team as a ***Junior C++ Developer***, whose mission and vision aligns with mine.

## My Mission and Vision In Life

+ :dart::earth_asia: My Mission : 
> Creating engineering solutions, software systems and products that are environmentally optimal, robust, sturdy, inherently intuitive to use and beautiful to look at with larger than life character to it!</br>
+ :dart::checkered_flag: My Vision : 
> I want to leave behind a better and a sentient world than I know as it is today. Through my work and attitude towards life, I want to positively influence people I am surrounded with and those who rely on the products that I help create. I believe in looking at bigger picture, doing good and pouring my heart and soul into my creations!</br>
